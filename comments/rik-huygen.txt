These are my comments on the git-crash-course

* It took quite some time to create this presentation and I have the feeling it is just in the starting phase.
  This is the first time given for such a divers group of attendants.

* I would really appreciate any comments on the following crash courses:

  * Linux and Mac Introduction

  * Introduction to git and GitHub

* The course was great!
