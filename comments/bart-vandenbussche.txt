* Very clear pictures for the workflow fork/clone/push/pull request, I finally undrstand it now !
* Would be useful to indicate on this work flow what is a button push on the githithub website and what is a git command
* Show in the github website how to get the github URL to use with your git clone command

* I would not have complicated the story with branches.  You might have scared people away, while they don't need it for most purposes
