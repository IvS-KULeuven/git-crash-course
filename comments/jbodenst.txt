I liked both of the courses, they gave a nice overview over Linux and Git - thanks for that! I 
always like it, when I can "get my hands dirty" and try the things out right away, so I would
have preferred a more interactive setting of the course. And for the future: it might be a good
idea to have two separate courses, one for the beginners (that might have been confused about
the quick changes between bash, python, ...) and the people that have some experience already.
