Comments from Miguel Montarges (FWO post doc at IvS)

I have some experience with both Linux and Git. However I still learned several tips from the Linux introduction session.
I am not sure about the level of the talk. Indeed, I fear it was a bit high for people with no Linux/Unix experience at all.
On the other hand, for users with some experience (even few), most of the stuffs were probably already known (or accessible with the man command).
Would it be possible to split the audience in 2 groups next year: "new users" and "users with some experience" ?

I learned Git myself this spring. Definitely this presentation was perfect for new people and the idea of sending (mandatory) comments via Git is really great.
I did not learn much as this covered only the basic functionalities of Git I use every day. However, I discovered that it was possible to put the name of the active branch
in the shell's prompt. I am very grateful for that !

As a summary, I would like to insist on the fact that these presentations were useful but I feared that new people were easily lost. A Linux hands on session might be something to consider
(also in order to make people realize that there is a graphical interface).
