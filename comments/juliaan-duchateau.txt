These are my comments on the first IT-training session

---------------------------
Linux and Mac introduction:
---------------------------
I learnt some new shortcuts, commands on some other tricks.
It was easy to follow if you are already familiar with Linux,
for unexperienced people it was going maybe a little bit fast.

-------------------------------
introduction on Git and Github:
-------------------------------
Very interesting course.
If I only had this info when I was doing my masters thesis.
During my masters I had to manually keep copies of all my folders like Latex,
Matlab, Android Studio... Which is a lot of work and kind of a mess.

From now on I will certainly use Git for version control!
