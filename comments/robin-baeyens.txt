First half of the infosession: Basic Linux and bash

Due to the wide audience that was present, the material that was presented was not always very
relevant. For 1st year master students, it likely was too difficult, since they have no experience with
linux command line or python. At would also be more clear if these students had been in front of actual
pcs so they can try things out themselves instead of only listening.
For people with some earlier experience (PhD students and up), this part of the session was quite 
boring, since most of the things covered were very basic indeed.
By trying to accommodate such a wide audience at the same time, I feel that the infosession went a bit
past both of them. Therefore I would suggest to first give a very basic and interactive introduction to
the 1st year master students, before organising a joint session with some more practical tips and
tricks that everyone might need.

Second half of the infosession: Git(Hub)

This part was very useful and also quite clearly presented. It would have been nice to get some more
concrete and simple, small examples of how git can really simplify your work, besides when working on
joint software development projects. 

Overall I am happy with the initiative and I will happily attend the coming IT infosessions.
