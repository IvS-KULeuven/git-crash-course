My comments on the IT training:

* Probably the new master students need an even more basic introduction to working with a terminal, because they might never have seen it before

* Maybe more example module files or examples from a proper bashrc file should be available to get inspiration from for individual porpose

* The slides were clearly structured, especially the slides about git and github. Such a step-by-step explanation is definitely necessary for a basic introduction
